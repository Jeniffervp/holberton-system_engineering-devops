# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them. The solution to this is the man command.
