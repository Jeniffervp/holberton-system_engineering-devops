# 0x1A. Application server

## Background Context

Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that you installed in your first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.

## Tasks

| Tasks | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0. Set up development with Python | Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server. Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000. Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code). |
| 1. Set up production with Gunicorn | Install Gunicorn and any other libraries required by your application. The Flask application object should be called app. (This will allow us to run and check your code). You will serve the same content from the same route as in the previous task. You can verify that it’s working by binding a Gunicorn instance to localhost listening on port 5000 with your application object as the entry point. In order to check your code, the checker will bind a Gunicorn instance to port 6000, so make sure nothing is listening on that port. |
| 2. Serve a page with Nginx | Building on your work in the previous tasks, configure Nginx to serve your page from the route /airbnb-onepage/. Requirements: Nginx must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port 80. Nginx should proxy requests to the process listening on port 5000. Include your Nginx config file as 2-app_server-nginx_config. |
| 3. Add a route with query parameters | Building on what you did in the previous tasks, let’s expand our web application by adding another service for Gunicorn to handle. In AirBnB_clone_v2/web_flask/6-number_odd_or_even, the route /number_odd_or_even/<int:n> should already be defined to render a page telling you whether an integer is odd or even. You’ll need to configure Nginx to proxy HTTP requests to the route /airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer) to a Gunicorn instance listening on port 5001. The key to this exercise is getting Nginx configured to proxy requests to processes listening on two different ports. You are not expected to keep your application server processes running. If you want to know how to run multiple instances of Gunicorn without having multiple terminals open, see tips below. Requirements:  Nginx must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port 80. Nginx should proxy requests to the route /airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer) the process listening on port 5001. Include your Nginx config file as 3-app_server-nginx_config. |
| 4. Let's do this for your API | Let’s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v3 - RESTful API on web-01. Requirements: Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v3. Setup Nginx so that the route /api/ points to a Gunicorn instance listening on port 5002. Nginx must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port 80. To test your setup you should bind Gunicorn to api/v1/app.py. It may be helpful to import your data (and environment variables) from this project. Upload your Nginx config file as 4-app_server-nginx_config |
| 5. Serve your AirBnB clone | Let’s serve what you built for AirBnB clone - Web dynamic on web-01. Requirements: Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v4. Your Gunicorn instance should serve content from web_dynamic/2-hbnb.py on port 5003. Setup Nginx so that the route / points to your Gunicorn instance. Setup Nginx so that it properly serves the static assets found in web_dynamic/static/ (this is essential for your page to render properly). For your website to be fully functional, you will need to reconfigure web_dynamic/static/scripts/2-hbnb.js to the correct IP. Nginx must serve this page both locally and on its public IP and port 5003. Make sure to pull up your Developer Tools on your favorite browser to verify that you have no errors. Upload your Nginx config as 5-app_server-nginx_config |
| 6. Deploy it! | Write a systemd script which starts a Gunicorn process to serve the same content as the previous task (web_dynamic/2-hbnb.py). The Gunicorn process should spawn 3 worker processes.The process should log errors in /tmp/airbnb-error.log. The process should log access in /tmp/airbnb-access.log. The process should be bound to port 5003. Your systemd script should be stored in the appropriate directory on web-01. Make sure that you start the systemd service and leave it running. Upload gunicorn.service to Github |
| 7. No service interruption |  application servers are designed with a master/workers infrastructure. The master is in charge of: Receiving requests. Managing workers (starting, stopping). Distributing requests to workers |
